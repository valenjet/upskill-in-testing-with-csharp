# Upskill in Testing with C#
This is the original _Upskill in Testing with C#_.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with the examples in this book, you need the following:
* A good working knowledge of the C# language. Neither C# nor .NET is explained in detail.
* This book was written using zsh on a Mac. The commands are mostly limited to _cd_ to change director, _ls_ to list files, and the _dotnet_ command to run the tests.
* The IDE used is Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the C# Dev Kit extension.

### Windows and flavors of Unix

This book won't show you how to use Windows and the various flavors of Unix. The book sticks to the Mac and avoids the command names that are different, the forward slashes (/) instead of back slashes (\\), and the one file hierarchy vs many file hierarchies rooted in different drive letters.

If you know your Windows or Unix shell, all examples should be runnable on the terminal-like application that you choose to use.

### Another IDE

This book won't show you how to use another integrated development environment (IDE). If you know your IDE, all examples should be runnable in the IDE that you choose to use.
