## Why testing?

Automated testing plays a crucial role in various aspects of software development and operations. Its importance spans enhancing application quality, ensuring site reliability, establishing pipeline trust, and ultimately contributing to customer satisfaction. Let's explore each of these areas in detail:

### Application Quality

- **Consistency and Accuracy**: Automated tests perform the same steps precisely every time they are run, eliminating human error from manual testing processes. This consistency ensures that defects are identified consistently and accurately.
  
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Automated testing can cover a vast array of test scenarios, including complex use cases and edge cases, in a fraction of the time it would take to execute them manually. This comprehensive coverage significantly improves the quality of the application by ensuring all functionalities are verified under diverse conditions.

- **Early Detection of Defects**: Automated tests can be integrated early and throughout the development lifecycle (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines), allowing for the early detection of defects. Early detection leads to defects being fixed before they propagate to later stages, reducing the cost and effort required for remediation.

### Site Reliability

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Automated testing isn't just for pre-deployment stages; it can also be utilized for monitoring the production environment. Synthetic monitoring, a form of automated testing, simulates user interactions to ensure that the website or application is functioning correctly at all times, thereby enhancing site reliability.

- **Performance Testing**: Automated tests include performance testing, which ensures that the application meets the desired performance benchmarks and can handle the expected load. This is crucial for maintaining site reliability, especially during peak traffic periods.

### Pipeline Trust

- **Repeatability**: Automated tests provide a repeatable process for validating code changes, configurations, and deployments. This repeatability builds trust in the deployment pipeline, as stakeholders can be confident that passed tests mean the software is ready for the next stage or production.

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Automation speeds up the testing process, allowing for more frequent deployments. Faster feedback loops increase the development team's efficiency and confidence in the deployment pipeline, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

### Customer Satisfaction

- **Reduced Downtime**: By ensuring higher quality and site reliability, automated testing minimizes the chances of bugs and performance issues affecting the end-users, thereby reducing downtime or poor user experiences.

- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Automated testing accelerates the testing phase and enables quicker releases. This means that new features, improvements, and fixes reach the customers faster, improving their overall satisfaction with the product.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: By rigorously testing the application to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions, automated testing contributes to a smoother, bug-free user experience, which is directly linked to higher customer satisfaction levels.

In summary, automated testing is a cornerstone of modern software development practices, underpinning the delivery of high-quality, reliable applications. It not only supports technical objectives but also aligns closely with business goals, particularly in terms of enhancing customer satisfaction and trust in the product.

## Why NUnit?

In [The Art of Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Unit_Testing), Roy Osherove writes, "quite a battle between MSTest and NUnit, simply because MSTest is built into Visual Studio. But, when given a choice, I’d choose NUnit for some of the features you’ll see later ..."  The advocates for using NUnit, including myself, want you to access these features and advantages. I recommend Roy's book as a comprehensive way to compare and contrast all the options.

Here's a summary of the reasons why I recommend NUnit:

1. **Simplicity in Writing Test Cases**: NUnit allows for writing test cases in a simpler and more readable manner compared to other frameworks. NUnit uses an attribute scheme to recognize and load tests.

2. **Powerful Fixture System**: NUnit's fixture system is highly flexible and powerful, enabling reusable setup and teardown code for your tests. Fixtures can easily be defined with an attribute, and NUnit automatically handles their creation and disposal when running tests. This can lead to cleaner, more maintainable test code.

3. **Parameterized Testing**: NUnit makes it straightforward to run a single test function with multiple sets of parameters using the `TestCase` or `TestCaseSource` attribute. This feature is extremely useful for covering a wide range of input conditions with minimal code.

4. **Automatic Test Discovery**: The NUnit Test Engine API is a published API for discovering, exploring and executing tests programmatically. There are many third-party test runners (e.g. Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider, etc.) that use the Engine API to execute NUnit tests.

5. **Rich Plugin Architecture**: The NUnit Test Engine uses a plugin architecture that allows users and third parties to add new functionality to the engine. The extensibility model defines a number of Extension Points to which Extensions may be added.

6. **Detailed and Informative Test Failure Reports**: When tests fail, NUnit provides detailed and informative failure reports. NUnit automatically saves its results in XML format, allowing you to produce reports or otherwise process the results.

Test runners use these NUnit reports to help you quickly identify what went wrong, making debugging more efficient.

7. **Community and Ecosystem**: NUnit has a large and active community, which means there's a wealth of resources available for learning and troubleshooting, as well as ongoing development of NUnit itself and its ecosystem of plugins.

8. **Flexibility**: NUnit is designed to be flexible and adaptable to many different types of test scenarios, from simple unit tests to complex functional testing. It can be used in projects of any size, from small scripts to large systems.

These features combine to make NUnit a powerful and user-friendly testing framework that can simplify the testing process, enhance test code quality, and improve developer productivity. Roy Osherove's book delves into these aspects in detail, demonstrating how to effectively use NUnit in .NET projects.
